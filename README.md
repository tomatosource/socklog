# socklog

A basic websocket logging util library to help debug terminal UI applications, or any app thats tricky to write to log to stdout, where for whatever reason you don't want to log to file.

Built upon [Gorilla's Websocket package.]("github.com/gorilla/websocket")

```
go get github.com/tomatosource/socklog
```

## Usage

```

socklogger := socklog.MustNew("localhost:8080")
defer socklogger.Close()
log.SetOutput(socklogger)
```

### Log as normal

```go
log.Print("hello world")
```

## Options

```
$ socklog --help
Usage of socklog:
  -addr string
    	http service address (default "localhost:8080")
```

## Other Features

None planned, but this whole repository is less than 100 lines of Go (not counting examples), so it should be fairly easy to poke around in and extend.
